// TODO: Reassess whether these tests are actually necessary.
// These tests require hitting real network endpoints that may or may not be up at any particular
// time.  Those endpoints also require someone's personal tenant to be available with an app.
// That doesn't handle the loss of a team member very well.

// NOTE: See previous commits for the last known version of this file.  I am gutting it for now
// as a way of disabling the test until we can figure out what to do with it.
